UPDATE: This method is not working.

Flat Style Colored Keyboard is Only Available for 4.3.x - 5.1.x. But I found method to work with 4.1 & 4.2.

So follow the instructions :

First things first:

What you need:

1\. Xinstaller Xposed Module. Get it from [here](http://goo.gl/q1c9Xx) or Direct Download Link: [Download](http://dl-xda.xposed.info/modules/com.pyler.xinstaller_v466_a691a1.apk).

2\. Flat Style Colored Keyboard. Get it from [here](http://goo.gl/EUpLbj) or Direct Download Link: [Download](http://dl-xda.xposed.info/modules/com.bocharov.xposed.fskeyboard_v124_006395.apk). If you have Flat Style Keyboard apk then skip this download.

Procedure: 1. Enable Xinstaller in Xopsed Installer. Then Reboot your phone. 2. After reboot open xinstaller. 3. Then go to Installations. Then Select Checking SDK Version. 4. Now download or install fs colored keyboard. You see that the apk is installing. 5. After Installing enable fs Keyboard in Xposed installer & then reboot your phone. 6. You should see that the module is working.
