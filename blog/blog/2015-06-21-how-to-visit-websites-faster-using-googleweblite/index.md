Google shows faster, lighter pages to people searching on slow mobile connections in selected countries. To do this, we convert web pages on the fly into a version optimized for slow networks or 2G Networks, so that these pages load faster while saving data. These optimized pages preserve a majority of the relevant content and provide a link for users to view the original page. Our experiments show that optimized pages load four times faster than the original page and use 80% fewer bytes. Because these pages load so much faster, we also saw a 50% increase in traffic to these pages.

Pages are currently transcoded for searches from the Chrome browser, Google App and the Android browser (version 2.3+).

You can manually convert by Browsing below link: http://googleweblight.com/?lite\_url=your\_website\_url Where your\_website\_url is the URL you want to visit.

Example: If you want to visit WordPress on GoogleWebLight then Type below URL in browser

[http://googleweblight.com/?lite\_url=http://www.wordpress.com/](http://googleweblight.com/?lite_url=http://www.wordpress.com/)

> Some pages are currently not transcoded, including video sites, pages that require cookies (such as personalized sites), and other websites that are technically challenging to transcode. In these cases, you will see a "not transcoded" notification.
